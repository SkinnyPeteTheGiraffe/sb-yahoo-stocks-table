# Spring Boot Practice: Stock Comparison Table
 * Date: 05/05/2019

 ## Description:
 A Spring Boot project I created as I continue learning the Spring 5 framework. This project simply grabs stock data 
 from within our StockService using the Yahoo Finance API, which generates a list of POJO's representing StockData, and 
 is passed through the StockController, into the view `stock` which is mapped to `"/"`, and is styled with vanilla 
 CSS for aestheticism.
 
 *Has no real world use, just wanted to explore the possibilities using the Spring framework.*
